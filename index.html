                            <h1>Liz is a programmer and designer for the web and games. Her main career interest is web design and front-end development.</h1>
                            <p>Liz is currently attending university full-time where she is studying information technology.</p>
                            <p>Some of the technologies she has used in projects are Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, <a href="http://jobographic.cozymaus.com" target="_blank" title="Jobographic Web Application">APIs</a>, and <a href="http://njcommunitymentalhealth.org"
                                    target="_blank" title="Non-Profit CBMHS Website">Wordpress</a>, although she also loves making graphics and illustrations. Currently she is interested in Wordpress (and maybe Tumblr) theme development and is working on making a <a href="http://cozymaus.com" target="_blank" title="cozymaus.com">blog</a> and maintaining a social media presence.</p>
                            <p>When not coding, she is either watching dramas or anime, writing, or posting her artwork online. As a completionist, she loves checking off every little thing that has to be done. She has a family of parrotlets which she loves dearly, and unsurprisingly considers birds and lizards some of her favorite animals.</p>
                            <p>She is currently looking for an internship in the Central Jersey area in web development, design, video games, or another IT position.</p>
